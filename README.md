## All my plugins come as is but I don't mind helping if you need it, do not use these if you don't understand simple LUA. I don't care if you change the names or remove my name etc, your choice. I decided to release these since the community I was on is moving away from Helix and onto something else so enjoy :)

<ins>**Bodygrouper Saver/Perma**</ins>
- For this to work you MUST have a manager like "simple_bodygrouper" etc or some way for the players to edit their bodygroups, all you do is put this into plugins and it will save on player disconnect/logout but if not you can use the command "/savebodygroups" to force a save

<ins>**Workshop/Faction Tab**</ins>
- Make sure you change the certain lines to fit what you need like the link for the Workshop button or the Faction list so it can match what factions you have.
